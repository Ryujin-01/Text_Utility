        This is a Tutorial Website built by none other than Mr Hocus_Xenophilus.
        This is the first step of Mr Hocul_Xenophilus towards becoming a great
        coder. So in this website you can manipulate text by changing it to
        Upper Case, Lower Case and Removing Extra Spaces. You can also count the
        number of words and characters, and also get the estimated time to read
        the document if your average reading speed is about 125 words per
        minute.
